# fractalTrees

Fractal Trees is a project I did for fun in my spare time. It was inspired by Java written code in a youtube challenge (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU&t=707s). I made modifications to the written code but added my own custom elements such as randomness and limb thickness. I also converted from Java to Python.
